# Machine Learning Studies

Goals:
1. Create simple NNs in Python using libraries
2. Assess performance and optimize these networks
3. Create simple bare-bones in Python NNs that achieve the same results as previous NNs without using the libraries that were used before
4. Translate the code from the previous step into three different languages:
    a. Java (forced modularity, compiled to object code, cross-compatible)
    b. Haskell (heavily optimized, compatible with C)
    c. Javascript (web-based, lightweight, mix of Java and Python structure)
5. Assess performance of each set of NNs based on the same tests run for the Python code
6. Compare, assess why differences in performance are the way they are (if drastic differences do exist)
7. Report on pros/cons/utilities of when/why each language should be used

Requirements:
- tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0
- keras==2.3.1
- numpy==1.17.2
